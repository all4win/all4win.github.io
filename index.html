			<strong>Welcome to Tiancheng's Homepage!</strong>	
			<h2 style="width:73%">Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
				Hi. I am Tiancheng Gong. I was living in Shanghai for my first 18 years. I came to the United States after completing my study at Shanghai High School.
				</br></br>
				I got my BS degree from Georgia Tech May 2016. And I've decided to go back to Georgia Tech to further my study as a graduate student. GO JACKETS! Probably I will still work on Machine Learning, NLP or other related fields because they are sooooooo interesting!
				</br></br>
			</p>
			<h2 style="width:73%">What am I doing?</h2>
			<p>
				I am currently interning at a startup company called Tezign, located in Shanghai, China. My work is mostly about the matching system that the company uses for its customers. My boss wants me to rebuild the pipeline of the matching process and implement some machine learning features so that matching accuracy can be improved. So far I feel very enjoyed doing this work. People here are nice, and the work environment is pretty good. And the most important thing is, I read a lot of related books and papers. I am training my brain as wells as my algorithm is training the models. So far so good:)
